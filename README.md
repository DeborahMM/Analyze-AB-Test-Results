Project for Data Analyst Nanodegree: Recommend which of two E-commerce landing pages to keep based on A/B testing

## Overview
This Udacity project is an A/B testing project run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users. The goal is to help the company understand through statistical conclusions if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Software
* Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy)
* Jupyter Notebook

## Part I - Probability
Compute the probabilities of converting.

## Part II - A/B Test
Conduct a one-tailed hypothesis test using sampling distributions and calculate the p-values.

## Part III - Regression
Create multiple logistic regression models that include other factors impacting the conversion rates.

## Part IV - Conclusions
Based on the previous methods, decide which page is better.
